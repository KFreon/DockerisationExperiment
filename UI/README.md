# Dockerisation Experiment  
Working in Managed Services, we tend to get projects with different versions of Node, Sql Server, etc  
I want to see how/if I can setup a Docker environment that can run these, so we don't have to fuss around so much to get it running or setup.  

I'm aiming for a `docker compose up` and the whole project "just works".
